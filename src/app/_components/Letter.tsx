                            Honourable Delegates and Most Distinguished Participants,
                            <br /><br />
                            My name is Ahat Oğuzhan Ergin, a senior law student at İzmir University of Economics, and it is my distinct honor and privilege to serve as your Secretary General for this transformative conference. Together with my exceptional Director General Zeynep Deliceoğlu, I am committed to leading a team whose sole purpose is to ensure you experience a Model United Nations that inspires, challenges, and empowers you to reach your fullest potential.
                            <br /><br />
                            My journey in MUN began in 2017, sparking a passion that has defined the last eight years of my life—years rich with debate, challenge, friendship, and meaningful change. From taking my first steps as a delegate to embracing leadership roles as a chair and organizer, every experience has deepened my belief in the power of this community. Today, I stand before you not only as an experienced MUN participant but as someone driven by an unwavering commitment to making this conference truly transformative for each and every one of you.
                            <br /><br />
                            When I initially entered the world of MUN, I considered it a significant enhancement to my résumé. However, as time passed, I understood that the real value of MUN is not found in résumé-building, but in personal development: the bravery to express oneself, the resilience to question perspectives, and the capability to listen and evolve. This is precisely what ECOMUN aims to provide: beyond mere simulation, it serves as a forum for young thinkers to tackle global challenges, refine their voices, and become insightful leaders through diplomacy, conversation, and mutual respect. Regardless of whether this is your inaugural conference or your tenth, I hope you discover, within these four days, an opportunity for introspection, connection, and meaningful self-discovery.
                            <br /><br />
                            These next four days are yours to own. Speak up when it&apos;s tough, contemplate when it seems simple, and always remember the importance of respect. Be courageous with your thoughts, open in your discussions, and fearless in questioning what you think can improve, as nothing is set in stone; this is where the true beauty is found. As the Secretariat, our mission is to support you throughout this experience, to guide you, and to make sure that ECOMUN becomes a venue for meaningful discussions, genuine development, and unforgettable experiences. We eagerly anticipate welcoming you to İzmir University of Economics this September and observing the ideas, energy, and enthusiasm you will contribute.
                            <br /><br />
                            With the deepest sincerity and hope,<br />
                            We welcome you all.
